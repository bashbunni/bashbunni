### A bit about me

Hey! I'm bashbunni, welcome to my GitHub page. I love open source and am always
striving to improve my coding skills. I share that journey online to give others
company along their journey and hopefully act as a source of encouragement along
the way.

I'm working with an incredible team of developers at [@charmbracelet][charm]
building developer tooling and a whole lotta libraries.

### What I'm hacking on

I'm keeping my personal projects private at the moment since my progress on them
is slow going. I'll definitely share them when I have MVPs ready, for now
they're just for my own learning and enjoyment :)

You can check out what I'm working on at [Charm][charm]. I bounce around all of
the projects over there.
